# Todo: Short Term

- Learn git merge
- Make my first snippet in LuaSnip
- Try to have a method to reflect on ourselves

# Till the end of March:

- Got good at Git
- Finish the Data Structures & Algorithms course with IntelliJ
- Learned basic Lua

# Low Priority

- Tmux environment saved theme
- Script AHK to:
  - Experiment with onWinActive function
  - When Youtube has transparency:
    - Pressing (tab) will alt-tab
    - Extending the alt-d function to go transparent then alt-tab

# Ideas

- Having a custom mode plugin that with a hotkey,
  transform our insert mode into a numpad layer.
