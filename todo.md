# Todo: P1:

- Check if we can do Custom Actions when picking a file in Telescope
  -> with that, we can write a special function that will require the files we pick.

# Pending Taks:

- Telescope custom hide and show
  -> We can build our own Telescope picker.

# Todo Project:

- Create a plugin / function that pick & save / load vim sessions

# Till the end of March:

- Learn Git Merge and Git Stash
- Finish 1 Data Structures & Algorithms course

# Low Priority

- Tmux environment saved theme
- Script AHK to:
  - Experiment with onWinActive function
  - When Youtube has transparency:
    - Pressing (tab) will alt-tab
    - Extending the alt-d function to go transparent then alt-tab

# Ideas

- Having a custom mode plugin that with a hotkey
